                During our visit to the Law Enforcement Department at Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA), we were given access to their central operating office, where real-time surveillance and monitoring of the entire Freeport Zone take place. Inside the control room, we observed multiple screens displaying live footage from CCTV cameras strategically installed across key locations in SBMA. The personnel explained how they utilize this system to monitor traffic, ensure public safety, and respond quickly to incidents. This visit gave us a firsthand look into how modern surveillance technology is integrated into daily operations to maintain order and security within the area.
