            The <strong>Light Rail Transit Line 2 (LRT-2)</strong>, also known as the <strong>Purple Line</strong>, is a <strong>rapid transit line</strong> in <strong>Metro Manila, Philippines</strong>, operated by the <strong>Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA)</strong>. It runs in an <strong>east-west direction</strong>, connecting <strong>Recto in Manila</strong> to <strong>Antipolo, Rizal</strong>, spanning <strong>17.6 kilometers</strong> with <strong>thirteen stations</strong>. Unlike earlier lines, LRT-2 uses <strong>high-capacity metro cars</strong>, which are <strong>longer and wider</strong>, similar in size to those on <strong>Hong Kong's MTR</strong>, making it a <strong>heavy rail line</strong>. The line was part of the <strong>Metropolitan Manila Strategic Mass Rail Transit Development Plan</strong>, envisioned in the <strong>1970s</strong>, and after delays, it was funded through <strong>Japan's official development assistance</strong>. It began operations in <strong>2003</strong> and became the <strong>first rapid transit line to extend outside Metro Manila</strong> when it was extended to <strong>Antipolo</strong> in <strong>2021</strong>. LRT-2 remains the <strong>least busy</strong> among <strong>Metro Manila's three rapid transit lines</strong>, with around <strong>140,000 passengers daily</strong> in <strong>2023</strong>. However, it faces <strong>peak ridership during rush hours</strong>. To address capacity issues, <strong>expansion projects</strong> are underway, including a <strong>three-station extension westward in Manila</strong>. The system integrates with other forms of <strong>public transport</strong>, including <strong>buses</strong> and <strong>jeepneys</strong>, allowing passengers to travel easily across the city

                During our visit to the Light Rail Transit (LRT), we first toured the station where the trains are maintained and repaired, gaining insight into the detailed process of ensuring the trains remain in top condition for public use. We learned about the different types of maintenance checks conducted regularly to ensure safety and smooth operations. Afterward, we were shown the room where the CCTV system monitors the entire LRT network, providing a comprehensive view of the operations and ensuring safety across the system. This surveillance system helps in tracking train movements and responding to emergencies quickly. Finally, we had the opportunity to experience an actual ride on the train, giving us firsthand knowledge of the service, its punctuality, and the efficiency of the LRT system in Metro Manila. This visit not only enhanced our understanding of the daily operations but also allowed us to appreciate the importance of maintenance and security in the success of the transit system.
