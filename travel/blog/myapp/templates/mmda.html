            <p>
                The <strong>Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA)</strong>, known in Filipino as <em>Pangasiwaan sa Pagpapaunlad ng Kalakhang Maynila</em>, is a <strong>government agency</strong> in the Philippines that oversees the <strong>regional governance of Metro Manila</strong>, which includes <strong>Manila, Quezon City, Caloocan, Pasay, Mandaluyong, Makati, Pasig, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Las PiÃ±as, ParaÃ±aque, Valenzuela, Malabon, Taguig, Navotas, San Juan</strong>, and the <strong>municipality of Pateros</strong>.

                It operates under the <strong>direct supervision of the Office of the President</strong>, carrying out <strong>planning, monitoring, and coordination</strong> tasks. The MMDA also holds <strong>regulatory and supervisory authority</strong> over the delivery of services across Metro Manila, while still <strong>respecting the autonomy</strong> of local government units on purely local matters.
                
                The agency is led by a <strong>chairman appointed by the President</strong>, who holds the <strong>rank, rights, and privileges of a cabinet member</strong> and serves at the <strong>President's discretion</strong>.

                During our visit to the MMDA, we had the opportunity to explore their conference room, which offered a direct view of the large CCTV monitor system displaying real-time footage from various roads across Metro Manila, particularly along EDSA. The system provided a comprehensive look at the cityâ€™s traffic situation and allowed us to witness how the MMDA monitors and manages road activities. We also had the chance to view actual footage and data from road accidents, giving us a deeper understanding of how they analyze incidents and respond to emergencies as part of their traffic management and public safety efforts.
