            <h2>What is Vessel Traffic Management System?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="about-right">
            <p>
                The <strong>Subic Bay Freeport</strong> has introduced a <strong>new Vessel Traffic Management System (VTMS)</strong> to modernize and enhance maritime operations. This upgraded system, initiated by the <strong>Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA)</strong>, is designed to improve <strong>efficiency, safety, and security</strong> at the Port of Subic, addressing limitations in radar coverage from the previous 15-year-old system.

                VTMS is a <strong>technology-driven system</strong> used in ports to <strong>monitor and manage ship movements</strong> within the harbor and nearby waters. It utilizes radar, AIS (Automatic Identification Systems), VHF radios, CCTVs, and specialized software to<strong>*track vessels, detect traffic, and assist in decision-making</strong> for safe port operations. The new Subic VTMS includes updated radar stations, improved hardware and software, visual surveillance, and a <strong>Port Management System</strong> for handling administrative tasks like billing and coordination with service providers.
                
                Funded with â‚±270 million and awarded to Northwind-Xanatos, this system not only boosts <strong>marine radar coverage</strong>, especially in previously blind spots, but also integrates <strong>financial and operational tools</strong>, aiming to position Subic as one of the worldâ€™s leading ports.

                During our visit to the VTMS (Vessel Traffic Management System) office at Subic Bay Freeport, we were given an insightful overview of maritime operations and port classifications. The staff explained the different types of portsâ€”such as commercial, passenger, and container portsâ€”and outlined the standard procedures and safety rules that govern vessel movements. One of the most fascinating parts of the visit was entering the actual VTMS control room, where we saw real-time monitoring of ships through advanced radar systems, large display screens, and communication equipment. We also had the opportunity to see the radar tower up close, which plays a crucial role in detecting and tracking vessels within the bay. This hands-on experience gave us a clearer understanding of how port authorities ensure safe and efficient navigation within the harbor.                <br>

    <h2>INSIGHT AND LEARNINGS ðŸ˜€ðŸ”­</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">
    ðŸ“Œ There are 10 ports within the Subic Freeport Zone, each serving various functions such as commercial, industrial, and tourism.<br>
    (Anchorage, Yacht Club, New Container Terminal, Rivera Pier, POL Piers, Nabasan Wharf, Marine Terminals, Leyte Pier, Approach Pier, Boton Wharf)<br>
    <br>
    ðŸ“Œ They utilize a personalized and modern Vessel Traffic Management System (VTMS) to ensure the safe and efficient movement of ships.<br>
    ðŸ“Œ Vessels docking in their ports are guided by assigned harbor pilots or captains familiar with local navigation rules.<br>
    ðŸ“Œ The VTMS control room operates 24/7, using radar, AIS, CCTV, and radio communication to monitor and manage vessel traffic.<br>
    ðŸ“Œ The radar tower enhances visibility and detection, especially in areas with limited line-of-sight.<br>
    ðŸ“Œ The system also includes a Port Management System for billing, logistics coordination, and port scheduling.<br>
    ðŸ“Œ Safety, environmental protection, and port security are top priorities in every ship movement.<br>
    ðŸ“Œ The visit highlighted the complexity and importance of maritime logistics and real-time monitoring in port operations.<br>
    ðŸ“Œ Exposure to real VTMS operations broadened our understanding of how technology supports global trade and maritime safety.<br>
