                Here is a paraphrased version of the paragraph with appropriate parts bolded using

                    The <strong>Presidential Car Museum</strong> (Filipino: <strong>Museo ng Pampangulong Sasakyan</strong>) is located inside the <strong>Quezon Memorial Circle</strong> in Quezon City, Metro Manila. This museum features a collection of <strong>vehicles once used by former Philippine Presidents</strong>.
                    
                    Plans to establish a dedicated museum for these historical cars began as early as <strong>2013</strong>, spearheaded by the <strong>National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP)</strong>.
                    
                    A site for the museum was secured through a <strong>memorandum of agreement</strong> between the NHCP and the local government of <strong>Quezon City</strong>. The city allocated approximately <strong>3,000 square meters</strong> for the museum's construction. The designated area, originally used for basketball and volleyball courts, was relocated within the park with expenses covered by the NHCP.
                    
                    The museum was <strong>officially opened on August 19, 2018</strong>.

As we roamed around the museum, the guide shared fascinating stories about the former Philippine presidents who used the cars, their historical significance, and how each vehicle reflected the era it represented.
